# Make Me Smaller

Custom built tool for resizing and optimizing images for web. Takes a single high res image, resizes it to various device-friendly sizes, optionally creates a very low-res "preload" image, optimizes, generates code to embed and returns a ZIP file containing the optimized images.

**THE CODE AS IT APPEARS IN THIS PROJECT DOES NOT FUNCTION**

About halfway through some large structural changes to this project, which was built for my employer, we switched to a private bitbucket repository. As such, the project as it appears now does not build or run properly and I likely will not take the time to update it in this repository. The code that remains here is purely for posterity.
